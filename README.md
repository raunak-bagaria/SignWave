SignWave : By Team DesiDecibels

We have developed a Machine Learning model that provides real-time, bidirectional translation between English and Indian Sign Language (ISL), fostering inclusive communication for individuals with speech and hearing impairments across India. Unlike solutions tailored for American Sign Language, our model is built on a dataset exclusive to ISL, ensuring precise and context-aware translations.

How it works:
Speech to ISL: Record your voice, which is converted to text and then translated into an ISL video.
ISL to Text: Capture real-time video in ISL, which is instantly converted into English text.
